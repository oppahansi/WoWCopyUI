# WoWCopyUI (Vanilla, TBC)
Copy your existing UI to a new Character - including updating all addon files.

## Info
This tool helps you copy your old UI to a new character.
It updates all folder names and all addon files to match your new character name and realm.

## Note:
This was initially designed for the guild [Vanguard](http://vanguard-kronos3.shivtr.com/) on the [Kronos](http://www.kronos-wow.com/) server.
That means, you can use UI templates made by this tool to set up a new UIs, see below how to make a template.

## Note 2:
Some UI setups require the related config.wtf file locaten in the WTF/ folder. This is not included in the process. In case your UI requires the config file, you have to include it yourself and dont forget to change the names in the config file before sharing. 

## Note 3:
Setting up a new UI on the same account but different char name will only update character specific addon cache files. Not the account wide addon cache files. Otherwise it would override your old character's setting with the new chosen char name and realm.

## How to:
0. Requires JAVA, may not work without admin rights, you need rights to write and read files and folders. Check code if you dont trust me.
1. Download latest WoW Copy UI.jar from [releases](https://github.com/oppahansi/WoWCopyUI/releases) (I suggest placing it into you wow folder, means less browsing during folder selection).

6. Click Setup UI / Create Template
7. Done.
