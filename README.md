## Info
This tool helps you copy your old UI to a new character.
It updates all folder names and all addon files to match your new character name and realm.

## Note:
This was initially designed for the guild [Vanguard](http://vanguard-kronos3.shivtr.com/) on the [Kronos](http://www.kronos-wow.com/) server.
That means, you can use specific UIs set up as templates, see below how to make a template.

If you dont have a template, you will have to check the 'Using existing UI?' checkbox and select an existing UI.

## How to:
0. Requires JAVA, may not work without admin rights, you need rights to write and read files and folders. Check code if you dont trust me.
1. Download latest WoW Copy UI.jar from [releases](https://github.com/oppahansi/WoWCopyUI/releases) (I suggest placing it into you wow folder, means less browsing during folder selection).
2. Start WoW Copy UI.jar
3. If you don't have a UI template or you dont want to use one, check the "Using existing UI?" box.
4. If you have a UI template and want to set it up, check the "Using existing UI?" box.
5. Fill out all fields.
6. Click Copy UI
7. Select the required folders, reflected in the title bars of opened windows. 
8. Done.

## Making a template

1. Follow the steps above up to 3. but check 'Using existing UI?'
2. Fill out the 'NEW' fields like this:
    1. NEW ACCHANTNAME : MYUSERNAME
    2. NEW Realm name : MYREALMNAME
    3. NEW Char name : MYCHARNAME
3. Fill out the 'OLD' fields with your current information.
4. Click on Copy UI.
5. Select your current Acc folder.
