## Info
This tool helps you copy your old UI to a new character.
It updates all folder names and all addon files to match your new character name and realm.

## Note:
This was initially designed for the guild [Vanguard](http://vanguard-kronos3.shivtr.com/) on the [Kronos](http://www.kronos-wow.com/) server.
If you dont have the Vanguard UI Template, you will have to check the 'Using existing UI?' checkbox and
select an existing UI.

## How to:
0. Requires JAVA, may not work without admin rights, you need rights to write and read files and folders. Check code if you dont trust me.
1. Download latest WoW Copy UI.jar from [releases](https://github.com/oppahansi/WoWCopyUI/releases) (I suggest placing it into you wow folder, means less browsing during folder selection).
2. Start WoW Copy UI.jar
3. If you don't have the Vanguard UI Template or you dont want to use it, check the "Using existing UI?" box.
4. If you have the Vanguard UI Template and want to set it up, check the "Using existing UI?" box.
5. Fill out all fields.
6. Click Copy UI
7. Select the required folders, reflected in the title bars of opened windows. 
8. Done.
